# Question

Will the code work? Why or why not?

```js
const getUsers = async () => {
  const url = 'https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users';
  const users = await fetch(url).then(r => r.json()).catch((err) => []);
  console.log(users)
  return users;
}
getUsers()
```

Again, running the code gives you the answer, so try to figure it out on your own first!

# Answer
Yes, the code will work as the fetch function will successfully get the data from the url. 

The `console.log(users)` will retrieve the users of the api and print them on the console

While your answer to the first part of the question is correct, you forgot to address the second part: Why or why not does this code work?
