# Question
Using `async`/`await` over `.then`/`.catch` makes our code for handling promises much more readable. What are the ways in which `async`/`await` is more readable than `.then` and `.catch`?

# Answer
Using the `async/await` syntax with try and catch has a number of benefits. The main ones being readability and debuggability.

 - We can write async code in a synchronous-like manner
 - We avoid having to write a bunch of callbacks
 - We can avoid common mistakes made when using callbacks
 - try/catch is a more general-purpose way of handling errors that can be used for more than just fetching.
